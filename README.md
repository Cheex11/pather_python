Homework assignment from a job interview


The python script accepts two variables when run from terminal.  The first variable is the name of the input file containing the block of characters.  The second variable is the name of the output file. 

The program will read through the input and find any characters "#".  It will then draw a line of #'s from the first # to the next #.  It can work with any size grid as long as there are a least two "#"s.
